# filMZ
## Description
This project aims to develop a film borrowing transaction management system implemented in C, utilizing data structures such as linked lists, tries, and hash tables with the chaining method, along with the djb2 hashing algorithm. The program allows users to register and log in, enabling them to search for films, upload film details, return films, and favorite their preferred titles.

By focusing on the management of film borrowing transactions, this program emphasizes efficient data storage and retrieval without handling actual film files. This project serves as a practical application of fundamental programming concepts and data structures, providing a valuable resource for developers interested in transaction management systems.
